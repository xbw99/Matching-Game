# Memory Game Project

When you start the page, the stopwatch will count the time you use in this game. At each step, you need to filp over a card and remeber the symbol behind that. Your goal is to match all the cards with the same symbols. Once you achieve the goal, a congratulation modal will show up and you will be asked whether you want to play again.
